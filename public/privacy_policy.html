            <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h3>
            <p>At BodyFrame, we appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</p>
            <p> <strong>We do not compromise with your privacy.</strong>We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy. </p>
            <p> <strong>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.</strong>Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices! </p>
            <p> <strong>We work hard to keep your information secure.</strong>We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information. </p>

The profile information we receive may vary depending on the app you are using, and on the third party provider concerned, but may often include details which may include your name, e-mail address, mobile phone number and friends list. If you login using your Facebook account, your e-mail or your phone number, then we may receive a unique ID in connection with this login. This is solely used for confirmation purposes and is kept separate from all other online identifiers. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Policy or that are otherwise made clear to you in the app you are using. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third party social media or email provider. We recommend that you see their privacy policies to understand how they collect, use and share your information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

            <p>When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies, small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters, to your device.

            <p>Note to readers of dailyburn.com/life: If you access <a href="#">http://dailyburn.com/life/</a>, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect and store information when you interact with that site, including viewing ads. We, and certain third parties we work with e.g. ad networks and data management platforms, may also use these technologies to better target ads to you based on your online browsing activities.</p>
            <p>We may also use web beacons when you visit the BodyFrame website.</p>
            <p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
            <p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>
            <p>More information on our use of cookies on our websites can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>
            <p>As described in Sections 3 and 5 of this Policy, we sometimes work with third parties to deliver offers. Sometimes we or these third parties do so through a mobile "SDK." The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable data to be collected and notifications to be shown. We may use this and similar technology to deliver certain notifications about our Services that may be of interest to you through mobile applications and browsers based on data we automatically collect from you. If you wish to opt out of these notifications through your mobile device, you can turn off notifications through your device "settings."</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">4.</span>  HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h1>

            <h1> <span class="number">5.</span>  HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h1>
            <p>Since our goal is to provide the best Services we can to you, the main sharing of users' information is with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the Services, with other IAC Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>

            <p> <strong>With our service providers and partners</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our Services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, marketing, advertising and security operations. Some examples of our providers are:
                    <p>Iterable (Customer Engagement)</p>
                    <p>Braze (Customer Engagement)</p>
                    <p>Firebase (Analytics)</p>
                    <p>Looker (Analytics and Reporting)</p>
                    <p>Braintree (Payment Processor)</p>
                </li>
                <li>We use your non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information) for targeted online marketing through tools like Facebook Custom Audience to contact interested parties.</li>
                <li>If you are a user living in the United States of America ONLY, subscribed to the Services as a result of an offer through your healthcare provider (e.g., Cigna, Aetna, Humana) and if you consented, we may provide information about your use of the Services to such provider.</li>
                <li>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner.</li>

            </ul>

            <p> <strong>With other IAC Group companies</strong> </p>
            <p>BodyFrame is part of the IAC Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Policy, includes websites and apps such as Ask Applications, Apalon and iTranslate (for more details, click <a href="#">http://iac.com/</a> ).</p>
            <p>We share your information with other IAC Group companies to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>assist us in technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, finance, legal, HR and accounting assistance, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.</li>
                <li>for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> <strong>For corporate transactions</strong> </p>
            <p>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.</p>

            <p> <strong>When required by law</strong> </p>
            <p>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</p>

            <p> <strong>To enforce legal rights</strong> </p>
            <p>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>

            <p> <strong>With your consent or at your request</strong> </p>
            <p>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</p>


            <h1> <span class="number">6.</span>  CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</h1>
            <p>Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance from the EEA to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. The United States, EEA Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live.</p>
            <p>The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of the EEA. If you live in the EEA, the company responsible for your information, IAC SAM EU, uses these Model Clauses or other suitable safeguards (such as EU-US Privacy Shield to send personal information to our partners and third party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the <a href="#">Privacy Shield Program</a> ) to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">7.</span>  YOUR RIGHTS</h1>
            <p>We want you to be in control of your information and be aware of your privacy rights, so here are a few key points to remember:</p>
            <p>Depending on your location you may have some or all of the following rights in relation to how we use your personal information:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Access: you may request access to your personal information and receive copies of it;</li>
              <li>Correction: you may have inaccurate/incomplete personal information corrected and updated;</li>
              <li>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information or to limit our use of it.</li>
              <li>Deletion: in certain circumstances, you can request a right “to be forgotten” (this is a right to have your information deleted or our use of your data restricted). We will honour such requests unless we have to retain this information to comply with a legal obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it.</li>
              <li>Portability: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider)</li>
              <li>Consent Management: where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time. You do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is based on consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or wish to object to our use of your information, please write to us at the address listed below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person. For example, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.</p>
            <p>For your protection, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests</p>

            <p><u>Device permissions.</u> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as camera and microphone as well as push notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain Services may lose full functionality.</p>
            <p><u>Uninstall.</u> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">8.</span> HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Your account information is protected by a password. We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>
            <p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at <a href="#">support@BodyFrame.com.</a></p>

            <h1> <span class="number">9.</span>  HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
            <p>We know that our customers lead busy active lives and, similar to a gym membership, sometimes may need to turn off our service for a while and then join back at a later time. For your convenience, we retain your profile and account information for so long as you use our Services and for up to 2 years following your suspension of Service so that you can be up and running quickly when you are ready to return.
Unless you have opted out, we may continue to keep you on our email list for so long as you use our Services and for up to 2 years thereafter to make you aware of improvements to our features and special offers. You can opt-out of those emails at any time.  We retain other information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services to you. We will also retain and use your information to the extent necessary:
</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to comply with applicable law;</li>
              <li>to evidence our compliance with applicable law;</li>
              <li>if there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li>
              <li>if the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as enforcing our terms or fraud prevention. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for security incidents from opening a new account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">10.</span> CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h1>
            <p>Our Services are intended for general audiences over the age of 18 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 18 years old. If you are not over 18 years old then DO NOT</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">11.</span> POLICY CHANGES</h1>
            <p>Because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you enjoy our services, this policy may change over time. We will notify you of any material changes to the way we use your information so that you have time to review the changes.</p>

            <h1> <span class="number">12.</span> DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</h1>
